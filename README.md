# Pet Breed Image Classification using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning-based image classification system developed for the **Computer Vision** final exam. It utilizes the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset to classify images of pets into their respective breeds. The model is built and trained using TensorFlow and Keras in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## üìå Problem Description

The task is to build a convolutional neural network that can identify and classify the breed of a pet (cat or dog) from an image. The challenge involves handling different classes, variable image sizes, and ensuring generalization across unseen data.

## ‚úÖ Solution Overview
